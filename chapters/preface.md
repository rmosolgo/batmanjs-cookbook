# About this Book

__To my knowledge, batman.js is currently unmaintained. For this reason, I don't recommend starting your next project with batman.js!__

This book is meant to be a quick-and-dirty how-to guide for [batman.js](http://batmanjs.org). I am gathering FAQs and examples from wherever I can and collecting them here!
